# p53

## _TP53_ gene

Tumor suppression is the main function of p53 protein, which is encoded by the _TP53_ gene on human chromosome 17. Mutation in the _TP53_ gene is detectable in about 50% of human breast, colon, lung, liver, prostate, bladder, and skin cancer.

The wild-type _TP53_ gene is translated into p53 proteins, which are transcription factors with an important role in orchestrating a variety of cellular responses such as DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, cellular senescence, cell death, cell differentiation, and metabolism thereby driving inhibitory molecular processes on cancer growth, preserving genomic integrity, thus acting as "guardian of the genome"

Central to genomic integrity, p53 acts as a guardian, orchestrating cellular responses to stressors like DNA damage and oncogenic signals, thereby functioning as a key tumor suppressor. TP53 is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancers. _TP53_ is located on the short arm of human chromosome 17 (17p13.1) and consists of 11 exons, 10 introns and 393 amino acid residues.

p53 has long been revered by cancer biologists as the “Guardian of the Genome”. It first emerged as a character in cancer discourse in the late 1970s and has since become one of the most studied genes with more than 80,000 related publications to date. Initially, p53 was conceptualized as a proto-oncogene; however, further investigations revealed that p53 primarily functions as a tumor suppressor.

Activated p53 can induce transient growth arrest, DNA repair, autophagy, senescence, apoptosis and necrosis.

## p53 alterations

Mutations in the p53 gene compromise its role as guardian of genomic integrity. Inactivation of the tumor suppressor p53 by mutations is the most frequent genetic alteration in human cancers. The common missense mutations in the _TP53_ gene disrupt the ability of p53 to bind to DNA and consequently to transactivate downstream genes.

Mutations of p53 are often alterations in the central DNA-binding domain and several hotspots such as R175, G245, R248, R249, R273 and R282, have been so far identified.

Virtually all p53 mutants studied to date have lost the ability to bind to DNA, thereby impairing its function as a transcription factor, and it seems likely that loss of this molecular function largely explains its role in tumor formation. When DNA damage occurs, the _TP53_ gene on human chromosome 17 stops the cell cycle. If p53 protein is mutated, the cell cycle is unrestricted and the damaged DNA is replicated, resulting in uncontrolled cell proliferation and cancer tumours.

Cellular stress, like DNA damage, telomere erosion, hypoxia, and nutrient depletion, as well as oncogenic signaling, activates p53, leading to the promotion of cell-cycle arrest, senescence, and apoptosis depending on the extent and context of the stress. These distinct stress responses are regulated by subsets of p53 target molecules, including p21, Puma, Tiger, and PAI-1, which respond to different p53-activating stimuli. The loss of p53 transcriptional activity that causes the suppression of these p53 target induction is thought to be a major mechanism by which _TP53_ loss-of-function mutations promote tumorigenesis in various organs including colon.
